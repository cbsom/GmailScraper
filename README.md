# GmailScraper
Gets a list of emails from Gmail using the regular Gmail search then searches through those emails to find values using regular expressions.

It's not as complicated/convoluted as it sounds and it can be awfully useful.

Note: The fist time it runs, it will open the browser to get gmail permissions.
